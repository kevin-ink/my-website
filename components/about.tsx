          Hi, I'm Kevinâ€”a recent University of California graduate (Aug 2024)
          with a skillset in software development and a commitment to continuous
          learning. I'm actively seeking an entry-level role where I can
          contribute my skills, innovate, and grow as a developer. Every day, I
          challenge myself by exploring new technologies and refining my craft
          through hands-on projects, which I document on my journey below. My
          experience as a Student Supervisor for the University's Unified Access
          Services honed my problem-solving, communication, and leadership
          abilities in dynamic environments. I'm excited to bring my technical
          expertise and enthusiasm for learning to a forward-thinking team.
